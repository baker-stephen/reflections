#1
Initializing a new repository doesn't do much other than create a .git
directory, yet it is absolutely necessary to do so before you make any
commits or track any changes. You can't use git at all until a repo is
initialized.
#2
The staging area offers a step to analyze the commit you are about to
make, whereas a working directory or repository will show the commits
you have already made.
