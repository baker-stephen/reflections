#1
Initializing a new repository doesn't do much other than create a .git
directory, yet it is absolutely necessary to do so before you make any
commits or track any changes. You can't use git at all until a repo is
initialized.
#2
The staging area offers a step to analyze the commit you are about to
make, whereas a working directory or repository will show the commits
you have already made.
#3
Adding certain files to the staging area makes sure you have one commit
per logical change if you use git status. Carefully analyze how much of
a change you have made, and whether or not the files you have entered
merit a seperate commit.
#4
I envision branches as being incredibly useful when performing
experimental tests or perhaps creating a version of a project designed
for a different platform, where all the basic mechanics remain the
same, but the layout changes.
#5
A diagram of branch structure can be useful for visualization purposes,
and aid in the organization of your repository. It can also help if
you're having difficulty remembering when you made a certain change, or
if another member of the group has been making changes to a particular
branch.
#6
Merging the two branches together results in the master branch being
"augmented" by the changes made in the coins branch, adding the lines
that were added to the mutual parent of both tips, and subtracting the
lines that were taken out by one of the tips from the mutual parent.
It makes sense if you don't overthink it.
