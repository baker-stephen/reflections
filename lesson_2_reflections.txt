#1
Initializing a new repository doesn't do much other than create a .git
directory, yet it is absolutely necessary to do so before you make any
commits or track any changes. You can't use git at all until a repo is
initialized.
#2
The staging area offers a step to analyze the commit you are about to
make, whereas a working directory or repository will show the commits
you have already made.
#3
Adding certain files to the staging area makes sure you have one commit
per logical change if you use git status. Carefully analyze how much of
a change you have made, and whether or not the files you have entered
merit a seperate commit.
#4
I envision branches as being incredibly useful when performing
experimental tests or perhaps creating a version of a project designed
for a different platform, where all the basic mechanics remain the
same, but the layout changes.
