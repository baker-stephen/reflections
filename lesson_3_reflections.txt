#1
Using a remote repository is especially useful when sharing work or
collaborating with others. If, instead, you'd like to keep the work to
yourself, keeping the work local would be the best option.
#2
Pulling changes manually keeps unnecesary commits from landing on your
computer and clogging up the works.
#3
A fork is like copying another repository on GitHub onto your own
account. Cloning a repository is where you copy it local to local or
web to local. A branch is used in the repository itself, for a number of
useful things. It's a copy of whichever branch it has been branched
from, and does not affect any other branch unless merged.
#4
Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally lets
you view all recent changes and possibly implement them. This way
you're not too far behind when you get back into internet access.
#5
Collaboration without Git or GitHub would be tedious and time-consuming.
It would require that each person looked for changes to other people's
code by hand, and thusly mistakes would be aplenty.
